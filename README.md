# ORB
It stands for Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief
It applies Fast algorithm to detect the key points and Brief algorithm for vector creation

# FAST Algorithm
Stands for Features from Accelerated Segments Test, quickly selects key points by comparing brightness of surroundig fearutes.

# BRIEF Algorithm
It stands for Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features.
After detecting features by FAST Algorithm, it makes feature vectors for all key points.
The vector contains the value depending of the surrounding brightness and contains only 0 & 1. That's why it is also called Binary Feature Vector.
